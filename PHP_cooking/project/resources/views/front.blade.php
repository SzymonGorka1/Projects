    Do you have feeling that you would like to cook something, but you have no idea what, so you give up on it completely? <br>
    Or that you'd like to finally talk to someone about whether basil pesto is better than tomato pesto, <br>
    but your friends only talk about the superiority of Python over C++? <br>
    Or just to get an honest opinion on your dishes, <br>
    not just hungry students for whom everything will be delicious as long as they're not the ones doing the cooking? <br>
    If you answered yes to at least one of these questions, you've come to the perfect place! <br>
    <b> CookIT </b> is a community of amateur cooks cooking together and getting to know each other while solving interesting challenges! <br>
    Find out if you too are worthy of our cooking hat today!
