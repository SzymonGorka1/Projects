Cook and Connect Application - Readme
Welcome to the Cook and Connect application! This application is designed for individuals who want to learn how to cook but lack specific recipe ideas, and also wish to meet new people. Below, you will find a project description and instructions on how to use the application.

Project Description
The Cook and Connect application aims to bring together individuals who want to learn how to cook by exchanging and preparing different dishes. The main functionalities of the application include:

User Registration and Account Creation: Users can register in the application by creating their accounts. During the registration process, users indicate their culinary skill level from which they want to start their cooking journey.

Random Dish Allocation: Each week, the application randomly assigns a recipe created by another user based on the culinary skill level of each user. This allows users to receive diverse recipes and explore new flavors.

Cooking and Delivery of Dishes: To have the task approved, users must prepare and deliver the completed dish to the assigned user within a week. The delivery of the dish can be done either in person or through the application.

Reviews and Point System: After receiving and tasting the dish, users provide reviews within the application. Reviews contribute to a point system that influences the difficulty level of recipes and occasional events.
